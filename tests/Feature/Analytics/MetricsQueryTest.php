/**
 * The general read over `usage`: any breakdown the allowlist permits, rather than a new endpoint
 * per question.
 *
 * A query endpoint over a shared table is only defensible because of what these cases pin. The
 * dimensions of `usage` are not equally shareable, so there are two ways to be allowed to break
 * down by one that NAMES something — a video, a viewer, a viewer's address: either the query is
 * narrowed to one project, in which case those identifiers are the caller's own, or the caller
 * names exactly what it is asking about, which bounds the question to values it already had. The
 * customer-label column pins the query to the caller's account on top of that, and the two fleet
 * columns take only the first route, because there is no list of edges a tenant could name.
 *
 * The service is stubbed — the suite has no ClickHouse fixture — so what is under test is the
 * authorization and the shaping, which is where this endpoint can go wrong.

# Streaming & VOD

NukeVideo serves **pre-packaged, static CMAF**. Encoded renditions are packaged once by [shaka-packager](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-packager) into shared segments that are stored on S3 and served as-is. There is no on-the-fly repackaging at request time.

## One Package, Both Protocols

Each output's renditions are packaged once into CMAF fragments. Because HLS and DASH can reference the same fragmented-MP4 segments, that one package serves **both** protocols:

| Protocol | Manifest | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| HLS | `.m3u8` | Apple devices, most browsers, widest compatibility |
| DASH | `.mpd` | Android, smart TVs, DRM-ready |

Subtitles are packaged separately for each protocol — fragmented-MP4 WebVTT for DASH, plain WebVTT for HLS, whose players cannot read the fragmented form — and grafted into the matching manifests. Multiple audio and subtitle tracks (with per-language labels) are supported.

## How Delivery Works

The packaged segments and manifests live on S3. A delivery layer sits in front of the bucket to enforce access control and cache segments close to viewers:

```
Client → Delivery (proxy node or Bunny CDN) → S3 (CMAF) → Client
```

1. The client requests a manifest with a signed token.
2. The delivery layer validates the token.
3. The manifest is served, then the client fetches the CMAF segments it references.
4. Segments are cached at the edge; manifests for 30 seconds, so an update is picked up within half a minute.

There are two delivery paths — self-hosted **proxy nodes** or **Bunny CDN**. Both serve the same static CMAF from S3; only the front door differs. See [CDN & Delivery](/guide/cdn) for the full comparison and setup.

## Requesting a Playback URL

The API mints signed manifest URLs for a video in one call — every output, and every format each
one serves:

```
POST /api/videos/{ulid}/play
```

The URLs point at whichever delivery layer is configured (a proxy node host or the Bunny pull-zone
host) and carry the access token. The answer is a flat list of `sources`: one entry per output and
format, each carrying its `format`, its `videoCodec` and its `audioCodec`, so you can rule one out
before loading it. A manifest that cannot be served is absent. Full shape in
[Playback URLs](/api/videos#playback-urls).

**Request body** (all optional):

The body is camelCase, like every write in this API. A snake_case key is not bound to anything
and is silently ignored — `tracking_id` does not fail the request, it just leaves the playback
unattributed.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `resolution` | integer | Caps every output's ladder at this height. Nothing else in the body selects what comes back — every format each output serves is in the answer. |
| `ip` | string | The viewer's address, when the link is minted from your backend; defaults to the caller's. Neither delivery layer enforces it today: the self-hosted token carries it but the edge never checks it, and Bunny tokens are not IP-bound, so a link plays from any address until it expires. |
| `speedLimitKbps` | integer | Caps the transfer rate of every request the link produces, in kilobits per second. See [Speed limits](#speed-limits). |
| `trackingId` | string | Your own tracking id for this viewer — a customer, a campaign. It never appears in the link: the mint records the link's token against your id server-side, so every request the link produces — the manifest, each segment — is attributed to it in the [bandwidth analytics](/api/analytics#bandwidth-by-tracking-id) when the CDN log is ingested. Up to 64 characters of `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ -`. The mapping is best-effort (it lives server-side, for the token's lifetime plus a margin). When omitted on a session or personal-token request the traffic is attributed to the ULID of the authenticated user — the admin panel's own playback stays attributed that way. A project key that omits it leaves the traffic unattributed: naming the viewer is the integrator's job. |

## Token-Based Access Control

Playback URLs are signed with a time-limited token so segments can't be fetched without authorization.
One token covers a whole playback session — the manifest and every segment the player derives from
it — and it is minted by the API with the provider's **token window** (one hour by default), or with
the `expiresIn` the request asked for, up to a week. The segments do not get a window of their own:
they expire with the link, so a session that outlives it has to request a fresh link.

The exact signing scheme depends on the delivery layer:

- **Proxy nodes** validate Akamai-style tokens (HMAC) scoped to the manifest's directory, rewrite the manifest so its segment URLs carry that same token, and read the segments from S3 using AWS authentication.
- **Bunny CDN** uses HMAC-SHA256 tokens in directory mode: the token is a path prefix scoped to the video's directory, so the manifest and all of its relative segments authenticate under one token.

Either way the token is what ties a session's traffic back to the link that was minted, which is
how a `trackingId` is attributed without ever appearing in the URL.

## Speed limits

Every link mint — [playback](/api/videos#playback-urls), [a track](/api/streams#download-a-track)
and [a video's tracks](/api/videos#download-tracks) — takes an optional `speedLimitKbps`: a cap on
the transfer rate, in kilobits per second (`64` to `10000000`). Kilobits because that is the unit a
rendition's bitrate is quoted in, so `3000` keeps a player below a 1080p rung that needs more; for
a download, divide by 8 for kB/s.

The limit is part of the signature, not a parameter next to it, so a viewer who edits or removes
it gets a 403 rather than a faster link. Because the segments carry the manifest's token, one
capped playback link caps the whole session.

- **Proxy nodes** carry it as a `limit` field of the token, in bytes per second, which the edge reads back once the
  HMAC has passed and applies to the response.
- **Bunny CDN** gets its own [`limit` parameter](https://bunny.net/docs/cdn/security/token-authentication/advanced#speed-limits),
  signed with the token. Bunny counts it in kB/s, so the API divides by 8 (never below `1`,
  since `0` means "no limit" to Bunny).

It is enforced **per request**. A player fetching two segments at once, or a download manager
opening four ranged connections, gets the limit on each of them — it caps a connection, not a
viewer.

A limit needs a signed link: with no token secret (proxy nodes) or no token key (Bunny) there is
nothing to sign it into, and the mint answers `422` rather than a link without the cap. A proxy
node still running an older edge validates the token and serves it unlimited: redeploy the node
to enforce it.

## Caching

The delivery layer caches CMAF **segments** locally (or at the CDN edge) so repeated requests don't hit S3 every time. **Manifests** are cached for 30 seconds: the cache keeps the bucket's copy and the edge writes each viewer's token into it on the way out, so a playback start skips the trip to S3 and still gets a token of its own. Manifests and subtitle cues are served gzip-compressed. A self-hosted proxy node caches into its own disk pool, sized automatically — see [Nodes: Cache disks](/guide/nodes#cache-disks).

## Bandwidth Monitoring

On self-hosted proxy nodes a Vector.dev pipeline parses the access logs and ships bandwidth data to the API (`POST /api/internal/bandwidth`, secured by a shared internal secret), which sums them into per-video, per-IP daily usage rows for analytics.

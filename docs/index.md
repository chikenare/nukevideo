features:
  - icon: 🎬
    title: Distributed Encoding
    details: Videos are split into chunks and encoded in parallel across worker nodes with FFmpeg, SVT-AV1, and x264/x265. Audio is transcoded to AAC.
  - icon: 🎯
    title: Per-Title VMAF CRF
    details: The pipeline probes sample windows of each source, measures VMAF, and interpolates the CRF needed to hit a target quality per rendition.
  - icon: 📦
    title: Static CMAF Packaging
    details: shaka-packager builds each output once into shared CMAF segments that serve both HLS and DASH — subtitles included. No on-the-fly repackaging.

    title: Flexible Delivery
    details: Serve through self-hosted proxy nodes with token-validated S3 delivery, or point a Bunny CDN pull-zone at your S3 origin. Chosen per deployment.

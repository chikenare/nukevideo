## What NukeVideo is

An open-source video processing and delivery engine: it takes a file uploaded straight to S3,
transcodes it in parallel by spreading keyframe-aligned windows across remote worker nodes (CPU or
GPU), packages it as CMAF (HLS + DASH over the same segments) and serves it through a CDN. The
admin panel is a first-party SPA, and there is a public API for external consumers.

Monorepo: **Laravel 13 backend at the root**, **Vue 3 SPA in `front/`**, **VitePress docs in `docs/`**.

**There is no `app/Actions`, no `app/Http/Requests`, no `app/Policies` and no `routes/web.php`.**

## Commands

Everything runs in Docker. Never run `php`, `composer`, `pnpm` or `artisan` directly on the host.
The backend container is **`nukevideo-api`** (not `app`).

```bash
docker compose up -d                                          # bring the stack up
docker compose exec nukevideo-api php artisan <command>
docker compose exec nukevideo-api composer <command>

# Tests — ALWAYS clear the config first (see "Gotchas")
docker compose exec nukevideo-api php artisan config:clear
docker compose exec nukevideo-api php artisan test

docker compose exec nukevideo-api ./vendor/bin/pint           # format PHP
docker compose exec nukevideo-api php artisan migrate
docker compose exec nukevideo-api php artisan clickhouse:migrate
docker compose exec nukevideo-api php artisan typescript:transform   # regenerates front/src/types/generated.d.ts
docker compose exec nukevideo-api php artisan data:cache-structures  # after editing app/Data
```

Frontend (`front/`, **pnpm only** — the lockfile is `pnpm-lock.yaml`). The Vite dev server already
starts with `docker compose up -d` (it is the container's `CMD`), so `exec` is only for the checks:

```bash
docker compose exec nukevideo-front pnpm run lint         # eslint . --fix --cache
docker compose exec nukevideo-front pnpm run type-check   # vue-tsc --build
docker compose exec nukevideo-front pnpm run format       # prettier
```

Docs (`docs/`, pnpm as well): the `nukevideo-docs` container serves `docs:dev` at
`docs.nukevideo.localhost`. To build: `docker compose exec nukevideo-docs pnpm run docs:build`.

**CI is the reference for what must pass** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, on PRs to `main` only):
`./vendor/bin/pint --test` and `php artisan test` at the root, plus `pnpm exec eslint .` (no
`--fix`) and `pnpm run type-check` in `front/`. Images are published on `v*` tags only.

> `composer dev` and `composer setup` are stock Laravel scripts and **are broken here**: they call
> `npm run dev` and `npm install` at the root, where there is no `package.json`. Use
> `docker compose up -d`. `composer test` does work (it runs `config:clear`, then `artisan test`).

## The encoding pipeline

This is the heart of the project; understand it before touching `app/Jobs` or `app/Services`.

Direct multipart upload to S3 (Uppy) → bucket webhook → `OnVideoUploaded` creates the `Video`
(status `PENDING`) and its `original` stream → the `videos:dispatch` scheduler claims a worker slot
and dispatches **`PrepareVideoJob`** (`orchestration` queue), which downloads the source from
primary S3 **exactly once**, mirrors it to the LAN `chunks` store, probes it into `Output`s and
`Stream`s, runs the probes (per-title CRF, bitrate, preflight), plans keyframe-aligned windows and
fans out **one `Bus::batch` per hardware queue** with a `ProcessChunkJob` per (window × rendition).
`EncodeSidecarTracksJob` (audio and subtitles in a single pass, never chunked),
`ExtractThumbnailJob` and `GenerateVideoStoryboard` run alongside it. The last batch's `then()`
moves the video to `UPLOADING` and dispatches **`PackageVideoJob`** (`packaging` queue,
`ShouldBeUnique`), which concatenates the chunks with `-c copy`, runs shaka-packager once per
distinct height over a shared segment tree, grafts the subtitles in with `ManifestEditor` and
`s5cmd sync`s everything to primary S3. `CompletesVideo` closes the video out.

Concepts worth having straight:

- **Stream** = one concrete track (`original` | `video` | `audio` | `subtitle`). A "rendition" is a
  video stream. Segments live under `{videoUlid}/{streamUlid}/`.
- **Output** = one CMAF package / manifest family, 1:1 with an entry of the template's
  `query.outputs[]`. **Streams are shared across outputs** when their resolved parameters are
  identical; what is per-output is the manifests.
- **Template** = a JSON `query` column holding `outputs[].variants[]`. `config/ffmpeg.php` is the
  codec catalogue and the schema for every parameter (rules, `available_for`, flag template).
- **`chunks` disk vs `s3`**: `chunks` is a RustFS on the LAN, disposable (mirrored source, chunks,
  staged sidecars). Primary `s3` is read once and written once per video.
- **Queues**: `default` (API host only), `orchestration` (every worker), `packaging`,
  `video-processing` (CPU) and `video-processing-{intel,nvidia}` (GPU nodes do not drain the CPU
  queue). `config/horizon.php` picks the supervisors from `NODE_TYPE`/`NODE_ACCEL`.

Project-specific configs: `ffmpeg.php` (codec and parameter catalogue), `packager.php`, `nuke.php`
(webhook/internal secrets, worker timeout), `template-presets.php`, `horizon.php`,
`filesystems.php` (the `chunks` disk).

## Backend conventions

- **Business logic lives in `app/Services`**, not in controllers. There are no Actions — do not
  introduce the pattern. Trivial CRUD does sit inline in the controller; destructive or multi-step
  work goes to a service.
- **Data objects are the validation layer.** There are no FormRequests and nothing calls
  `$request->validate()`.
  - Input: `app/Data/{Domain}/{Store|Update}{Model}Data.php` extends `App\Data\RequestData`, which
    supplies `toDatabase()` (a snake_case array, omitting absent `Optional` fields).
  - Output: `app/Data/{Model}Data.php` extends `Data`, with a `fromModel()` built from named
    arguments.
  - **Casing**: the global *input* mapper is snake_case and the *output* one is camelCase
    (`config/data.php`). That is why every property that has to accept camelCase from the panel
    carries `#[MapInputName(CamelCaseMapper::class)]` **on the property** — a class-level
    `#[MapName]` is ignored on input. `rules()` keys are written in camelCase.
  - No `#[TypeScript]` attributes: the whole `app/Data` and `app/Enums` directories are transformed.
- **Thin controllers**: promoted constructor injection, the Data object injected as an action
  argument, and `response()->json(['data' => XData::fromModel($m)])` on the way out.
- **Project scoping**: `$request->project()` is a Request macro that aborts 400 when no project is
  resolved. Every resource query starts there
  (`$request->project()->videos()->where('ulid', $ulid)->firstOrFail()`). Looking a resource up by
  ULID without that scoping is a cross-tenant leak, not a style slip.
- **Routes** (`routes/api.php`, flat, **unversioned**): three groups inside `auth:sanctum` +
  `throttle:api` — `no-project-key` (account-wide), `resolve.project` (project resources) and
  `['no-project-key', EnsureAdmin::class]` (admin). Picking the wrong group is a security bug: a
  project API key authenticates **as the project**.
- **Jobs**: always set `$tries` and `$backoff` deliberately, with a comment on the reasoning; heavy
  ones also set `$timeout`. The queue goes in a class constant
  (`private const QUEUE = 'orchestration';`) and dispatch goes through `->onQueue(self::QUEUE)`.
  Constructors take **primitives**, not models. `failed()` marks the video with `markAsFailed()`.
- **Models**: the ULID is assigned in a hand-written `boot()` (there is no `HasUlid` trait); the
  primary key stays the auto-increment and the ULID is the public identifier. `casts()` is a
  method. Observers are registered with `#[ObservedBy]`. Models carry a fair amount of domain logic
  and the storage-path constants.
- **Migrations**: see `/migration`. Anonymous class, a docblock explaining **why**, always a
  `down()`, `Schema::hasColumn` guards so they can be re-run, and compatible with MariaDB **and**
  SQLite (no `JSON_EXTRACT`; guard `dropForeign` for sqlite).
- **Style**: Pint on the default preset (there is no `pint.json`). The codebase does **not** use
  `declare(strict_types=1)` outside `Services/Cdn` and the ClickHouse migrations, and has no
  `final` classes: follow what is there rather than introducing a second style.
- Comments explain **why**, and reason about failure modes. That density is the house style.

## Frontend conventions

- Composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">`, always.
- **Never hand-write API types.** They come from `front/src/types/generated.d.ts`
  (`App.Data.VideoData`, `App.Enums.VideoStatus`), generated from the Data objects. If something is
  missing, fix the Data object and regenerate. The file is committed; do not edit it.
- `front/src/services/` — one class per domain with a `BASE_PATH`,
  `constructor(private api = apiClient)` and a single exported instance. The central axios client is
  `front/src/services/api.ts` (interceptors: `X-Project-Ulid` header from localStorage, 401 →
  `/login`, 422 → `ValidationException`).
- Pages live in `front/src/pages/` (not `views/`). Pinia stores are setup stores.
- `front/src/components/ui/` is generated shadcn-vue: never edit by hand (it is excluded from ESLint).
- Prettier: no semicolons, single quotes, print width 100.

## Gotchas that cost hours

- **`config:clear` before the tests.** `TestCase::setUp` drops and re-migrates the database; with a
  cached config it reads the development connection and **wipes the real database**. There is a
  guard that aborts, but clear the config anyway.
- **Spatie Data structure cache**: after editing a class in `app/Data`, new properties vanish from
  the JSON. It lives in the `file` store, not Redis: `php artisan data:cache-structures`.
- **The database is MariaDB**, whatever the global guide says about PostgreSQL. Write migrations
  for MySQL.
- Worker containers run a baked image with no code mount: testing a change there means `docker cp`
  plus `horizon:terminate`. Deploying while `APP_ENV=local` builds that image on the node instead of
  pulling it (release targets, from the compose project's directory, tagged `:node-dev` — `:dev` is
  compose's own runtime-only image and must not be reused), so a redeploy ships the working copy. A
  node with no working copy on it pulls that tag instead, which is how an external test node gets
  it; that needs `DOCKER_REGISTRY` set, and only then does a development build get pushed anywhere.
- Everything a deploy names is prefixed `nukevideo_dev_` in local and `nukevideo_` otherwise
  (`Node::containerPrefix()`). Both environments number their nodes from their own database, so
  without that a dev deploy would replace the production containers on the same host. Vector is
  deployed **only on proxy nodes with the self-hosted CDN** — nothing else produces the access-log
  lines it ships, and Bunny is covered by `bunny:ingest-logs`.
- Retrying a video takes more than `status = pending`: delete its `job_batches` row first (the
  chunks survive, so the retry is a cache hit).

## Rules for Claude

- Before creating a file, look for the equivalent that already exists and follow its pattern.
- Do not add dependencies without asking.
- **Never edit generated files**: `front/src/types/generated.d.ts`, `front/src/components/ui/`.
  Fix the source and regenerate.
- Do not touch `.env` or secrets; if a variable is missing, say so and add it to `.env.example`.
- Do not modify infrastructure (`compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, Traefik, the `vod/` nginx, CI) unless
  explicitly asked.
- When you finish backend work: Pint and the relevant tests. Frontend: lint and type-check.
- If a change implies a destructive data migration, stop and ask.
- Conventional Commits, in English, imperative mood. Do not push unless asked.
- **This is an open-source project: everything in the repository is written in English** — code,
  names, comments, docblocks, commit messages, documentation and this file included.

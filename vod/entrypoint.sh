# ---- Cache sizing ----
#
# The cache is sized to the filesystem it sits on, not configured: a proxy node's deploy hands
# this container a pool of disks that exist for nothing else. Three numbers come out of `df`:
#
#  - max_size:  everything but a reserve. nginx's cache manager evicts by LRU to stay under it.
#  - min_free:  the reserve itself. max_size only counts what the manager knows about — it is
#               blind to misses still streaming into temp files (use_temp_path=off puts those in
#               the cache dir) and, for hours after a restart of a big cache, to everything the
#               loader has not indexed yet. min_free is measured with statfs, so it holds in both
#               windows. Running the filesystem out of space is the one thing that must not
#               happen: a failed write truncates the viewer's segment, and everyone waiting on
#               the same miss behind proxy_cache_lock gets the same truncated bytes.
#  - keys_zone: ~8k keys per MB (nginx docs). A segment is a few MB, so a 10 TB pool holds
#               millions of them, and the stock 20m would force-expire entries long before the
#               disk was used. Sized at 2 MB per object on average; a cache of smaller objects
#               simply fills the zone first and evicts from there, which is still LRU.
#
# VOD_CACHE_MAX_SIZE set is the exception: the deploy sets it when the cache has no pool and is a
# docker volume on the OS disk, which the edge must not be allowed to fill. Sizes use `g`/`m`:
# nginx does not parse a `t` suffix.

# the bind mount then hands this container the empty mount point directory on the OS disk — and
# sizing the cache to *that* filesystem would let the edge fill the OS disk. Missing marker with
# the flag set means exactly that: say so loudly and cap the cache at the fallback size instead.
# The marker is a hidden directory, not a file: nginx's cache loader deletes every file under
# the cache that is not a cache entry, so a marker file would be gone by the next restart.
# The cap mirrors App\Services\ProxyCacheService::FALLBACK_MAX_SIZE, what a host with no pool

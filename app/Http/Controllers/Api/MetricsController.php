/**
 * The general read over `usage`: whatever breakdown a consumer needs, without a new endpoint each
 * time it needs a different one.
 *
 * This controller is where the authorization lives, and it is the reason a general query endpoint
 * over a shared table is defensible at all. The dimensions are not equally shareable
 * ({@see MetricDimension} spells out why), so each one states what it requires and this action
 * enforces it before any SQL is built.
 *
 * The rule, in one sentence: a dimension that NAMES something is answered only when the query is
 * narrowed to a project, or when the caller names the values it is asking about. There is no
 * operator shortcut — an administrator that names no project is refused exactly like anyone else,
 * because the fleet-wide view lives on the admin-only per-node report and not here.
 *
 * On top of that, the customer-label dimension and the metrics booked per account pin the query to
 * the caller's own account, which is a different axis from the project and narrows further.

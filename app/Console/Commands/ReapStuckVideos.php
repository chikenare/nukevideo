     * including redelivering whatever a dead worker dropped. The reaper's real job is the case the
     * queue cannot fix — no batch at all (preparation died), or every batch finished with the
     * video never transitioning (packaging died).
     *
     * The ceiling is the escape hatch: if the jobs are still pending long after any queue could
     * plausibly deliver them (a flushed Redis, a fleet that never came back), they are not coming.

/**
 * Keeps dead proxies out of new playback links.
 *
 * A proxy that stops answering is not stopped by this — its containers are the operator's to
 * manage, and nothing here can tell a crashed node from one the API host simply cannot reach.
 * It only counts silence: after {@see Node::HEALTH_FAILURE_THRESHOLD} consecutive failures the
 * resolver hands the node's videos to its ring neighbours, and one good probe puts it back.
 * Viewers mid-session on a node that dies are lost either way; this is for the next ones.
 *
 * Liveness is a 2xx/3xx carrying `X-NukeVideo-Edge` with the node's own id. The header is the
 * whole test: a Traefik with no router for the host answers 404, Cloudflare answers 403 or a
 * challenge page, a wrong DNS record answers somebody else's site — all of which have status
 * codes and none of which is the edge. An edge from before the header existed fails the probe
 * too — redeploy it. Should the API host lose the fleet altogether, the resolver's fallback
 * keeps linking to every active node regardless ({@see Node::findProxyForVideo()}).

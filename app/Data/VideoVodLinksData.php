 * reason code: what a caller does with "this one is not playable" and with "this one does not
 * exist" is the same thing — play something else — and `sources` already says what it can play.
 * The whole-request failures stay whole-request, because they are conditions of the video.
 *
 * The thumbnail and the storyboard sit at this level because they are per-video and unsigned: the
 * same two URLs whatever the caller ends up playing.

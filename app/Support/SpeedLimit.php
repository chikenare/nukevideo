 * playback can compare the two directly — a 3000 kbps limit is what keeps the ladder below the
 * 1080p rung. Downloads use the same unit rather than a second one: divide by 8 for kB/s.
 *
 * The limit lives INSIDE the signature, never next to it: a `limit` field of the self-hosted token
 * ({@see SelfHostedProvider::sign}), Bunny's signed `limit` parameter ({@see BunnyProvider}).
 * Anything outside the HMAC is the viewer's to edit, and a cap the viewer can delete from the URL
 * is not one.

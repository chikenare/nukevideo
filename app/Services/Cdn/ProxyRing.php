/**
 * Which proxy serves a given video, by consistent hashing over the routable fleet.
 *
 * Every node shares the token secret, so any of them can serve any video; what the ring buys is
 * that a video's segments are cached on one node rather than on all of them.
 *
 * The answer is resolved once per request rather than once per call. The ring is derived state —
 * the routable set queried, then {@see REPLICAS} points hashed per node and sorted — and it used
 * to be rebuilt on every lookup. That is invisible on a playback link, which asks once, and
 * expensive on a listing: {@see VideoData::fromModel} resolves a thumbnail AND a storyboard URL
 * per row through {@see AssetUrlResolver}, so a page of 25 videos paid the query and the sort
 * fifty times over for an answer that cannot change inside one request.
 *
 * The memo is per instance, and the instance is held by {@see CdnProvider}, which is bound
 * `scoped` — so the answer lives exactly as long as the request or the job that asked for it,
 * and is never cached across them. That matters: the set it reads is what `nodes:probe` rewrites
 * every minute, and a node leaving the fleet has to reach the next link rather than the next TTL.
 * The table is a handful of rows behind one small query, so the single query a request now makes
 * is not worth trading for staleness.
 *
 * Nothing binds this class itself. It has no constructor to satisfy, so the container builds one
 * per holder, and today the only holder is the provider above. Anything that later injects a
 * second one gets its own memo — correct, just one more query; binding it `scoped` at that point
 * would share the memo again without touching a single call site.

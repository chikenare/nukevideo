 * Prefers the CDN: the edge serves the `assets/` zone unsigned, so the URL is stable and both the
 * browser and the edge cache can keep it — which is the whole point, since these are rendered once
 * per row in a listing. Bytes stop passing through PHP entirely.
 *
 * Falls back to the API route ({@see VideoController::getAsset}) when no
 * proxy node is available, so images still resolve on an installation with no CDN fleet — which is
 * every fresh one, and every local checkout.

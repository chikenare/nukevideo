/**
 * Packages subtitle tracks into a directory that already holds the manifests they belong to, and
 * grafts the resulting text entries into each of them.
 *
 * Kept apart from {@see PackageVideoJob} because the same work has to run against a
 * directory rebuilt from S3 when an already-published video needs its subtitles repaired
 * ({@see RepairSubtitlesCommand}) — one implementation, two callers.
 *
 * Subtitles are packaged in SEPARATE single-segment runs (a few KB each — no point segmenting them
 * like video), one run PER format: DASH needs fMP4 `wvtt` (with an init segment, or dashjs 404s
 * fetching the BaseURL dir) while HLS needs raw `text/vtt` (hls.js can't parse fMP4) — see
 * {@see PackagerCommandBuilder::buildText}. Separate from the main run because `--segment_duration`
 * is global.

/**
 * Mints download links, for one track or for a video's worth of them.
 *
 * Downloads are per-track and API-only: the packaged renditions carry no audio
 * ({@see ChunkTranscodeService} encodes video with `-an`), so anything playable has to be muxed
 * from the pieces, and that is the caller's job. Each signature stays scoped to the object it
 * hands out — the batch mints N signatures, it does not widen one.
 *
 * The batch exists because almost nothing about a mint varies per track. Auth, the project
 * resolution, the video's status and the proxy node are all per VIDEO, so a caller fetching
 * forty tracks one call at a time paid them forty times — and Sanctum stamps `last_used_at` on
 * every request, so that was also forty writes to one row. Keyed by video rather than by an
 * arbitrary list of streams precisely so that hoisting them is valid.

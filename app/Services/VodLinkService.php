/**
 * Mints a whole video's playback links in one pass.
 *
 * The same argument as {@see DownloadLinkService::forVideo}: auth, the project resolution, the
 * video's status and the delivery node are per VIDEO, so a player that has to try three outputs
 * — or one output in two formats — paid all of it once per manifest, and Sanctum stamps
 * `last_used_at` on every one of those requests, all to the same row.
 *
 * Playback makes the case sharper than downloads did. A download token is scoped to its one
 * object, so N tracks genuinely need N signatures; a playback token is scoped to the manifest's
 * DIRECTORY — `token_path` on Bunny ({@see BunnyProvider::signed}), an ACL with
 * a trailing `*` on the edge ({@see SelfHostedProvider::aclFor}) — and every
 * output of a video packages into the same `{videoUlid}/play/` prefix
 * ({@see Output::packagePrefix}). So the signatures this loop produces all authorize exactly the
 * same bytes. Collapsing them to one is a change inside the providers (both are bound `scoped`,
 * so a per-request memo keyed on the directory would do it) and needs nothing from here or from
 * the {@see CdnProvider} contract — which is why this mints the obvious way and stays correct
 * either way.

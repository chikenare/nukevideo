/**
 * The edge cache disks of a proxy node: finding them, formatting them and mounting them.
 *
 * The bash itself is `resources/deploy/cache-disks.sh`; this class holds the constants the
 * rest of the application needs to agree with it, and the panel's read-only listing.
 *
 * A proxy node is dedicated hardware: a small NVMe (or a mirrored pair) carrying the OS and every
 * other disk meant for the segment cache, whole. So the deploy provisions those disks itself —
 * one mdadm RAID 0 across all of them (plain XFS when there is only one), mounted at a fixed path —
 * instead of asking the operator to prepare a filesystem and point the node at it.
 *
 * RAID 0 on purpose. The cache is a copy of what S3 holds, so redundancy would buy nothing but
 * lost capacity and write amplification; what it needs is throughput, and one spindle cannot
 * feed a 10 Gbps port. Linux md stripes unequal members by zones, so mixed sizes lose nothing.
 * A dead member loses the whole cache of that node, which the node survives: every miss is an
 * origin fetch until the disk is replaced and the node redeployed.
 *
 * What it must never do is format the wrong disk. Every block device that holds a mountpoint,
 * swap, or a RAID/LVM member whose assembled volume is mounted is the system's and is excluded
 * — which is how the OS disks are recognised, rather than by "NVMe means OS", because a cache
 * disk may be NVMe too. A disk already carrying this cache is assembled and mounted as it is: a
 * redeploy, which is how a node is updated, keeps the cache. Anything else among the remaining
 * disks is wiped, which is why the panel lists them and asks before a deploy runs, and why a
 * development panel ticks none of them — its deploy target is usually the developer's own
 * machine, where an unmounted disk is a backup, not a spare.
 *
 * Not every host has a disk to give whole, though: a server with nothing but two HDDs has the
 * OS on one of them, and most of that disk is the capacity it was bought for. A system disk
 * with unpartitioned space left on it is therefore offered as `shared`: ticked, the deploy
 * appends one partition over that space and makes it a pool member like any whole disk (or the
 * whole pool, on a host with a single disk). It never shrinks, moves or reformats what is
 * there, so the space has to be left unpartitioned when the OS is installed — a root
 * filesystem spanning the disk leaves nothing to carve, and no deploy is going to resize one.
 * GPT only, and never a disk that is whole a member of a mirror: see the script for both.
 *
 * Sharing is asked for by name, in a list of its own ({@see DeployNodeData}),
 * and refused when the disk no longer is what the panel showed.

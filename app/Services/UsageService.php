     * things it takes care of so that no caller has to:
     *
     * - Rows sharing their dimensions are folded here first. One statement must not name the same
     *   key twice, and a session flushed every minute names it often.
     * - The folded rows are written in a fixed order. Two ingest jobs upserting the same rows in
     *   different orders is the textbook InnoDB deadlock; in one order they simply queue.
     * - Everything goes in one transaction, retried on a deadlock. A batch is therefore applied
     *   whole or not at all, which is what makes retrying a failed job safe — a retry after half a
     *   batch would count that half twice, and a sum has no way to take it back.
     *
     * `country` rides along without being part of the key: it is a function of `ip`, so the rows
     * folded together agree on it, and the first one that knows it wins.
     *
     * @param  list<array<string, mixed>>  $rows  dimensions by column name, plus `value` and
     *                                            optionally `requests` (1 when absent) and `country`
